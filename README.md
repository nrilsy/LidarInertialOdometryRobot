# RobotTaskAssignmentSystem

This repository contains the code and resources for a Lidar-Inertial Odometry Robot project. The goal of this project is to implement an odometry system that fuses data from a LiDAR sensor and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) for precise localization and navigation in Gazebo Simulation Tool. The code is in the nuri-test branch.


Features
LiDAR Integration: Utilizes LiDAR for spatial mapping and obstacle detection.
IMU Integration: Processes inertial data to enhance motion estimation.
ROS2 Compatibility: Built using the ROS2 framework for modularity and scalability.
Real-Time Data Fusion: Combines sensor data for robust odometry.
Simulation and Testing: Compatible with Gazebo for testing and debugging.
Setup
Hardware Requirements
Raspberry Pi 3 (or higher) for computation.
